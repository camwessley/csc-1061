Chapter 11 Programming Project (100 points)
Read Chapter 11 in your book if you have not done so yet.
(THE PERSON, STUDENT, EMPLOYEE, FACULTY, AND STAFF CLASSES) Design a class named
Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty, Instructor and Staff
subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, ID number, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An
employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise
10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. An instructor has
a tier rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class
name and the person’s name.

Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Advisor, Faculty (full time), Instructor (part
time), and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
You should be using methods as needed and not using global variables.
