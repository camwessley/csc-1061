Chapter 12 Programming Project (100 points)
Read Chapter 12 in your book if you have not done so yet.
Write a hangman game that randomly generates a word (The program reads the words stored in a text
file named hangman.txt. Words are delimited by spaces or each on their own line.) and prompts the
user to guess one letter at a time, as presented in the sample run. Each letter in the word is displayed as
an asterisk. When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is then displayed. When the user
finishes a word, display the number of misses and ask the user whether to continue to play with another
word. Declare an array to store words, as follows (where the words are inserted in the array from the
file):

You will need to create the hangman.txt file of words.
You should also include error checking that a letter is entered (not a number or special character).
