Answer the following questions – please make sure to number them to
match the assignment.  Your only source should be your book.  The page
numbers might be a bit off because I have the flowable version of your
book but they should give you an idea.  Each problem is worth 2 points
unless specified differently in parenthesis.

You may either answer the questions electronically in Word (or
equivalent) or handwrite answers and scan.  Upload the file to the
