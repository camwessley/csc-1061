I am and always will be a vehement advocate for open access and accessibility of learning materials. DRM actively harms open access, and makes it difficult, or even impossible for people with disabilities to access learning materials. The content within was provided to me, to the best of my knowledge, legally and for free, in an inaccessible or challenging format for me to access. I put in a lot of effort to convert DRM learning materials into a HUMAN interpretable format, and I do so thanklessly and for free. The content within comprises my janky, half-baked extractions and conversions of inaccessible DRM learning material necessary for my course, provided in incomplete snippets, for educational, archival, and accessibility purposes. I do not own this content.
